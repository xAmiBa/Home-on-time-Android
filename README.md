Home on Time is an ongoing  project of a powerful safety app developed during the Power Hack, organized by SheCanCode at Dojo, with a primary focus on improving women's safety. The app provides users with a reliable way to notify their chosen contact when they expect to arrive home safely, based on their estimated time of arrival. Moreover, if the user fails to reach their destination within the specified time, Home on Time will automatically trigger an SOS message in the form of a text to the selected contact, ensuring that help is provided promptly.

This javascript / Next.js project prototype was created through the collaborative efforts of a skilled and diverse group of developers, including [Rachel Newby](https://github.com/rachelnewby), [Sonia Botsarova](https://github.com/sonianb), [Amy Kuner](https://github.com/amykuner), [Justyna Luberda](https://github.com/JLoobs) and [Amina Ba](https://github.com/xamiba). **The project was subsequently reimagined as a mobile app by Amina Ba.**
